## Showcase

## How to Use

It supports python 3.5 3.6 3.7 and most possibly future versions

`pip install bgAna`

```python
from bgAna import analyze_bg
img = cv2.imread('/home/matt/studyResource/.secretWeebFolder/waifu_no_435.jpg')
res = analyze_bg(img) # caution: color is in BGR


>>> print(type(res), res)
np.ndarray [125,125,125]
```

It also creates command line executable entry point by default

You should be able to run the following commands anywhere.

- `$ bgAna thonk.png`
    - output: `(125, 125, 125)`

- `$ bgAna -h` for more help
